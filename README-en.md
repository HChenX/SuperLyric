## 🔧 Technical Overview

- Uses **Binder** for lyric transmission, abandoning the traditional broadcast method used by other similar APIs.
- Avoids Hooking system interfaces directly; it is parasitic on the system framework and relies on the module's robust crash handling for greater stability.
- Utilizes Binder for synchronous inter-process data transfer, offering better performance, lower latency, and the capability to transmit more complex data, and is less likely to trigger broadcast data restrictions.
- Supports free binding or unbinding registration anytime, anywhere; even if not manually unbound, the module handles it automatically.
